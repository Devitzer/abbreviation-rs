# v0.1.0 - Initial Release!

Welcome to my new project, abbreviation-rs! <br>
It's purpose is to search for abbreviations (such as idk, lol, etc.) and output their full meaning! <br> <br>

The reason it is not in v1.0.0 is because there is not as much abbreviations as I would like (barely any right now), but it is relatively stable.
